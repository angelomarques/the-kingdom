# The Kingdom

The Kingom is app that is like the Forest. So it is a productivity app which can tracks you focus.

You can visit the app on <https://the-kingdom.vercel.app/home/>

The first screen that we see is the login page:

Then, when the user is logged he should see the home page:

In there we can change the countdown time and its label.
And on the navbar we can only access the settings. For now, the others buttons is disabled.

That's the screen when the countdown is running:

Once the session is finished, it will start an alarm sound and show this modal:

If you confirm and start the break, it will shows up this screen:
